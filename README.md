# Hello everyone 👋

I'm not really sure what to write here, so I'll just go with the template for now 😝.

- 🔭 I’m currently studying Computer Science at University of Havana. Not gonna lie, it's kinda hard, but totally worth it 👌.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the grounds of C# and some cool recursion strategies... and a lot of stuff in math I didn't even think existed. I mean what the heck is a vectorial space anyway?? 😰

- 💬 Ask me about the meaning of life. I won't say 42, promise.

- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me on Telegram as [@CyberNet_inc](https://t.me/CyberNet_inc)

- 😄 Pronouns: You can reffer to me by `asere` or `papa🥔`.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that one horse has 15 about horsepower??? Science has betrayed me :(
